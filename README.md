# 16-264_Project
Code for my 16-264 project--mostly used to research a classification task.

Project Flow:

1\) Run getImagesAndTags.m  
2\) Choose sample and run makefile.m (or alternative makefileCSV.m)

If makefile.m was run:

&nbsp;3.1.1) Run pickler.py to extract features and save object to file 
&nbsp;3.1.2) Run either classifytest.py for CNN or treeclassify.py for RandomForestClassifier

If makefileCSV.m was run:  
&nbsp;3.2) Run audioCNN2.py
